# Notes (read first!)

- A working brain üß†,Minimal knowledge about rooting a phone is needed. If you had never rooted a phone don't follow this guide.

- Backing up your data is necessary in case something goes wrong you will have options to recover.

- A similar tutorial [**video**](https://youtu.be/8dZZci43un8) on how to flash a single partition on spd phones from hovatek is also available you can watch it for deeply understanding my guide.
Note: Don't follow this Tutorial just watch in case if you are not understanding a single line of my guide.

- Some people makes stupid mistakes and their nvdata get crashed sometimes no network and also IMEI gets wiped it is highly recommend to understand every step carefully then proceed, if you follow my guide carefully you will not face such problems.

- Some users of Micromax in 2b reported that after the flashing procedure is done,if you try to trun on device it gets stuck at bootlogo or maybe goes into bootloop, in this case you need to press and hold both volume (+)/(-) and power button at same time to trun off the device then use volume up and power button to boot into recovery. Do a factory reset/ wipe data from there then it should trun on.

- All this phones share many similarities so a firmware of Micromax in 2b can also be flashed in symphony z33 or in2c. If you wish to flash another firmware, Yes you can! but proceed with caution ‚ö†Ô∏è i don't take any responsibility in case something happens wrong. i recommend you to stick with your device firmware, it does not guaranteed that if you flash another firmware device will boot without problems. As far as on my testing both Micromax  in2b/in 2c firmware booted successfully on (symphony z33).

- Remember always use [spd upgrade tool](https://androidmtk.com/download-spd-upgrade-tool-all-versions) for flashing a full firmware in any case if your device got soft or hard bricked or any other problems occurs* all though it won't happen if you follow my guide carefully.

## Flashing guide.
First of all you need a signed boot image and also a vbmeta-sign.img for rooting
You can get them from my [telegram group](https://t.me/UnisocT610Development).

Or you can use my [boot-img-puller](https://github.com/gitclone-url/Boot-img-puller) script to pull boot image from your firmware later you can use my [BIScript](https://github.com/gitclone-url/BIScript) to sign that particular image then you can flash it to your phone.if you flash without signing you will get bootloop for more info [read](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32664.html) this and [this](https://www.hovatek.com/forum/thread-32674.html).

Please note : if you use boot image and vbmeta-sign image from my telegram group then the firmware version that your phone is running on must need to matche with the provided firmware info in my pinned message **only** then you can use it.
